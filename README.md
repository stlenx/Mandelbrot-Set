Creates a visual representation of the Mandelbrot Set.

## Controlls

Top right of the screen you have controlls. Starting from the left to the right you can *set number of units to move to the right*, *scale*, *maximum number of iterations*.

At the top left you can see the position of the mouse, click and it'll calculate the julia set for that position.
